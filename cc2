It is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) Cloud computing platform that is fully managed and uses inbuilt
services to run your apps.
In particular, Google App Engine is designed to host applications with many simultaneous users.
Applications written for App Engine scale automatically. As more people use the application, App
Engine allocates more resources for the application and manages the use of those resources. The app
engine is a Cloud-based platform, is quite comprehensive and combines infrastructure as a service
(IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a service (SaaS).
The app engine supports the delivery, testing and development of software on demand in a Cloud
computing environment that supports millions of users and is highly scalable.
