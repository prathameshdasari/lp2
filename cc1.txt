Step 1)
 Login to your AWS account and go to the AWS Services tab at the top left corner.
 Here, you will see all of the AWS Services categorized as per their area viz. Compute, Storage,
Database, etc. For creating an EC2 instance, we have to choose EC2 as in the next step.
 Open all the services and click on EC2 under Compute services. This will launch the dashboard
of EC2.
 Here is the EC2 dashboard. Here you will get all the information in gist about the AWS EC2
resources running.
Step 2)
 On the top right corner of the EC2 dashboard, choose the AWS Region in which you want to
provision the EC2 server.
 Here we are selecting N. Virginia. AWS provides 16 Regions all over the globe.

Step 3) In this step
 Once your desired Region is selected, come back to the EC2 Dashboard.
 Click on &#39;Launch Instance&#39; button in the section of Create Instance (as shown below).


What is Ec2?
-Elastic Compute Cloud
-virtual compute server
-provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
-on which user can run their own applications.

Regin and Avalability zone:

Types of instance - 
1. General purpose
2. compute-optimized instances
3. memory-optimized instances
4. storage-optimized instances.
ex : t2.micro, t2.nano, t3.large, t3.medium, t3.xlarge,etc

Elastic:
Users can manage instances based on thier demand thus increase or decreas instances when ever needed.thus elastic.

Overall, Amazon EC2 provides users with a flexible and scalable infrastructure for running a wide range of applications, from simple web servers to complex distributed systems. It is widely used by businesses of all sizes to host their applications, websites, and workloads in the cloud.
